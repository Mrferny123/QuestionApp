# Question App

This app is a short Bible quiz app made using Swift and Canva for the graphics. In this project I learned a lot more about how binding variables work in Swift. I also learned more about how to design apps with Swift. One challenge I had during the creation of this app was figuring out how to put to make variables that were incremented in another page go to another.
